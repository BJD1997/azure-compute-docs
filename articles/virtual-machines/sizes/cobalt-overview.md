# Cobalt VMs Overview

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The Cobalt 100-based VMs are powered by Azure’s first-generation Cobalt 100 processor, delivering outstanding performance for both general-purpose and memory-optimized workloads. These VMs utilize Microsoft’s first 64-bit Arm-based Azure Cobalt 100 CPU which has been fully designed in-house. The Cobalt 100 processor, based on Arm Neoverse N2 design, aims to enhance performance and power efficiency for various workloads. Operating at 3.4 GHz, the Azure Cobalt 100 processor provides an entire physical core for each virtual machine vCPU.
